                     <h2>The Prayer, The Stranger, and the Promise</h2>
                     <p>
                        In December 2021, I knelt down in prayer with one clear request: “Lord, let me meet my husband in 2022.” I didn’t know how it would happen, or where, or when. I only knew that I believed it would.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      January 2022 arrived, and I was in full-blown mission mode — not for love,
                      but for leadership. I was on the hunt for new members for my cell group at church,
                       fueled by purpose, not romance. That Sunday, while scanning the congregation,
                        my eyes landed on two young men seated quietly at the back. One of them had
                   a quiet confidence about him — calm, observant, slightly mysterious.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        I walked over and boldly asked for their numbers.
                        We were still talking when a woman walked in and declared 
                        she had brought them to church. I politely stepped aside. 
                        No sparks, no magic — just another church connection… or so
                         I thought. <br>
                        His name was Charlse. <br>

                       After that day, we kept in touch occasionally. 
                       He was persistent, but in a calm, oddly prophetic way. 
                       “You’ll be my wife,” he said more than once, as though 
                       he was simply stating a fact the universe had already agreed on.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        I wasn’t impressed — not because he wasn’t charming, but 
                        because I wasn’t looking. My focus was razor-sharp: career, 
                        success, and checking off every goal I had set. I was a 
                        workaholic with a calendar full of meetings, not weddings.

                          But Charlse? He was patient. He didn’t chase — he waited. 
                          And waited. And somewhere along the way, his quiet declarations
                           started to feel less absurd, and more… destined.
                         <br>
                         By 2023, what started as a casual connection had evolved 
                         into courtship. Not the kind filled with butterflies and 
                         Instagrammable dates — but one grounded in friendship, 
                         faith, and a surprising sense of peace. It was as if 
                         everything had been orchestrated in advance, and we 
                         were just catching up to a story that had already been written.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        And then, in January 2024 — just two years after that first 
                        unexpected meeting — I married the man who once sat quietly
                         in the back of a church while I was too busy building to
                          notice he was an answer to my prayer. <br>

                        People always ask, “How did you know he was the one?” <br>

                       I smile and say, “I didn’t. But God did.” <br>

                        It was God Ordained
